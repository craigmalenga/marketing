### Railway Deployment Fixes and Database Initialization (31 July 2025 12:45)
**Problem**: Multiple deployment issues - numpy/pandas compatibility, SQLAlchemy datetime errors, import errors, database not initialized, Excel parsing failures, expanding charts
**Solution**: Fixed all deployment issues and added proper database initialization system
**Files Modified**: 
- requirements.txt (fixed numpy/pandas versions, updated python-docx)
- All model files (changed datetime.utcnow to func.now())
- app.py (fixed imports, added /admin route, added /api/init-database endpoint, updated upload history to use real data)
- services/__init__.py (removed MappingService from imports)
- services/data_processor.py (fixed ad spend parsing to match actual Excel structure)
- templates/index.html (fixed expanding charts)
- templates/marketing_campaign.html (fixed expanding charts)
- templates/admin.html (NEW - admin page for database initialization)
- railway.json (simplified configuration)
- Removed nixpacks.toml
**Technical Details**: 
- Fixed numpy 1.24.3 with pandas 2.0.3 compatibility
- Changed all SQLAlchemy datetime defaults from datetime.utcnow to func.now()
- Ad spend parser now looks for "Meta" sheet and correct column names
- Charts now use fixed height containers
- Added admin interface for database initialization
- Upload history now shows real data from database
**Testing Notes**: 
- After deployment, go to /admin and click "Initialize Database"
- Upload Excel files: they should parse without errors
- Charts should not expand infinitely
- Data persists between sessions

## ðŸš€ SESSION START PROTOCOL

### When starting a new session:
1. **FIRST WORDS**: "I'm reviewing the PROJECT_CONTEXT_MARKETING.md to understand the current system state..."
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE VERSION**: State the version and last update date you're reading
3. **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING**: Briefly summarize the latest changes documented
4. **ASK FOR UPDATES**: "Have there been any changes since [last update date] that I should know about?"
5. **READY CONFIRMATION**: "I'm ready to continue development on the marketing analytics platform. What would you like to work on today?"

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This is a web-based marketing analytics platform that replaces an Excel-based reporting system. The platform processes weekly data uploads to track marketing performance, credit applications, and approval rates across different products and campaigns.

### Key Business Process
1. Weekly data uploads:
   - Application passed/failed data (affordability checks)
   - FLG full data (lead information, sales values, status)
   - Ad spend data (campaign and ad level spending)
2. FLG to Meta name mapping (from Word document)
3. Status variant mapping (1s and 0s for application stages)
4. Generate two key reports:
   - Credit Performance by Product
   - Marketing Campaign Performance
5. Filtering capabilities by date range, campaign, product, ad level
6. Data persistence - manager can view reports without uploading new data

### Technology Stack
- Backend: Python Flask with SQLAlchemy
- Database: PostgreSQL (production) / SQLite (development)
- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript with Chart.js for visualizations
- File Processing: pandas, openpyxl for Excel files
- Deployment: Railway with PostgreSQL
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS via CDN

## DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION

### Railway Deployment Settings
- **Build Command**: (leave empty - Railway auto-detects)
- **Start Command**: `gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `SECRET_KEY`: (generate a secure random key)
  - `FLASK_ENV`: production
  - `DATABASE_URL`: (automatically set by Railway PostgreSQL)

### Database Initialization Process
1. Deploy app to Railway
2. Add PostgreSQL database
3. Visit `https://your-app.railway.app/admin`
4. Click "Initialize Database" button
5. Upload your Excel files

### Excel File Requirements

#### Applications Data (Excel)
- **Filename**: Any .xlsx file
- **Required Sheets**: 
  - "Affordability data - passed"
  - "Affordability data - failed"
- **Columns**: DateTime, Status, User, Lead ID, LeadDateTime, LeadName, LeadPostcode, LeadIntroducer, LeadPartner, LeadCost, LeadValue, CurrentStatus

#### FLG Full Data (Excel)
- **Filename**: Any .xlsx file
- **Required Sheet**: "ALL"
- **Columns**: Reference, ReceivedDateTime, Status, MarketingSource, Data5, Data6, Data7, Data8, Data10, Data29

#### Ad Spend Data (Excel)
- **Filename**: Any .xlsx file
- **Required Sheet**: "Meta"
- **Columns**: Reporting ends, Meta campaign name, Ad level, Spend, New -versus last weel?

## CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Excel Formula Translations
The Excel workbook uses complex formulas that have been translated:
- SUBTOTAL functions â†’ SQL aggregations with filters
- Pivot table logic â†’ Programmatic grouping and aggregation
- Cell references â†’ Database relationships
- Conditional formatting â†’ Frontend styling logic

### Data Processing Considerations
- Date formats vary between files (handled for both string and date objects)
- Missing data is handled gracefully
- Status names may have variations (exact matching used)
- All uploads are logged with timestamps
- Data persists between sessions

### Fixed Issues
1. **numpy/pandas compatibility** - Fixed with specific versions
2. **SQLAlchemy datetime** - Using func.now() instead of datetime.utcnow
3. **Import errors** - Removed circular imports
4. **Chart expansion** - Fixed with height containers
5. **Excel parsing** - Matches actual file structure
6. **Database initialization** - Admin page with init button

### Performance Optimization
- Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Report calculations optimized with SQL
- Connection pooling via SQLAlchemy
- Efficient Excel parsing with pandas

### Security Considerations
- File upload validation
- Secure filenames
- SQL injection prevention via SQLAlchemy
- XSS prevention in templates
- CSRF protection via Flask

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"No tables in database"**
   - Visit /admin and click Initialize Database
   - Or use DBeaver with Railway PostgreSQL credentials

2. **"Excel file has wrong format"**
   - Check sheet names match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - Ensure required columns are present
   - Ad spend must have "Meta" sheet

3. **"Charts expanding infinitely"**
   - Deploy the latest code with chart fixes
   - Clear browser cache

4. **"All values show zero"**
   - Upload data files first
   - Check database initialization completed
   - Verify date filters aren't excluding all data

5. **"Import errors on deployment"**
   - Check requirements.txt has correct versions
   - Ensure all files are committed to git

- [ ] Environment variables set (SECRET_KEY, FLASK_ENV)
- [ ] Start command is `gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`
- [ ] Database initialized via /admin

## CODE GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - READ FIRST ðŸš¨
**PLEASE GIVE ME THE FULL CODE - THIS IS IMPORTANT**
- Provide FULL FILES for each code you make changes to
- NO PLACEHOLDERS, NO ELLIPSIS, NO "rest remains the same"
- Full code with no loss of functionality
- Only replace or add as per requirements, preserve everything else
- Response in code area to right (artifacts system), not in chat below
- Focus on fully functional and exact code that will work first time
- If modifying even one line in a 1000-line file, provide all 1000 lines

### MANDATORY CODE GENERATION RULES:
1. **NEVER USE PLACEHOLDERS** - Every single line of code must be included
2. **COMPLETE FILES ONLY** - If modifying line 500 of a 1000-line file, provide all 1000 lines
3. **USE ARTIFACTS SYSTEM** - Code goes in the right panel, not in chat responses
4. **NO SNIPPETS** - Even for single-line changes, provide the entire file
5. **PRESERVE EVERYTHING** - Every comment, every blank line, every import
