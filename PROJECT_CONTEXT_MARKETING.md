## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This is a web-based marketing analytics platform that replaces an Excel-based reporting system. The platform processes weekly data uploads to track marketing performance, credit applications, and approval rates across different products and campaigns.

### Key Business Process
1. Weekly data uploads:
   - Application passed/failed data (affordability checks)
   - FLG full data (lead information, sales values, status)
   - Ad spend data (campaign and ad level spending)
2. FLG to Meta name mapping (from Word document)
3. Status variant mapping (1s and 0s for application stages)
4. Generate two key reports:
   - Credit Performance by Product
   - Marketing Campaign Performance
5. Filtering capabilities by date range, campaign, product, ad level

### Technology Stack
- Backend: Python Flask with SQLAlchemy
- Database: PostgreSQL (production) / SQLite (development)
- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript with Chart.js for visualizations
- File Processing: pandas, openpyxl for Excel files
- Deployment: Railway-ready with Procfile
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS via CDN

## CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Excel Formula Translations
The Excel workbook uses complex formulas that need translation:
- SUBTOTAL functions â†’ SQL aggregations with filters
- Pivot table logic â†’ Programmatic grouping and aggregation
- Cell references â†’ Database relationships
- Conditional formatting â†’ Frontend styling logic

### Data Processing Considerations
- Date formats vary between files (handle both string and date objects)
- Missing data should be handled gracefully
- Status names may have variations (use fuzzy matching)
- Maintain audit trail of all uploads

### Performance Optimization
- Index database on frequently queried columns
- Cache report calculations
- Paginate large result sets
- Use connection pooling for database

### Security Considerations
- Validate all file uploads
- Sanitize file names
- Implement user authentication (future phase)
- Log all data modifications
- Secure file storage

## CODE GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - READ FIRST ðŸš¨
**PLEASE GIVE ME THE FULL CODE - THIS IS IMPORTANT**
- Provide FULL FILES for each code you make changes to
- NO PLACEHOLDERS, NO ELLIPSIS, NO "rest remains the same"
- Full code with no loss of functionality
- Only replace or add as per requirements, preserve everything else
- Response in code area to right (artifacts system), not in chat below
- Focus on fully functional and exact code that will work first time
- If modifying even one line in a 1000-line file, provide all 1000 lines

### MANDATORY CODE GENERATION RULES:
1. **NEVER USE PLACEHOLDERS** - Every single line of code must be included
2. **COMPLETE FILES ONLY** - If modifying line 500 of a 1000-line file, provide all 1000 lines
3. **USE ARTIFACTS SYSTEM** - Code goes in the right panel, not in chat responses
4. **NO SNIPPETS** - Even for single-line changes, provide the entire file
5. **PRESERVE EVERYTHING** - Every comment, every blank line, every import

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Save all generated files** to your project directory maintaining the exact folder structure
2. **Create virtual environment and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Create .env file** from .env.example and set your SECRET_KEY
4. **Initialize the database**:
   ```bash
   flask init-db
   flask seed-test-data
   ```
5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
6. **Test with your Excel files**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5000
   - Go to Upload Data page
   - Upload your three Excel files
   - Check the reports

### Future Enhancements to Consider:

1. **User Authentication**: Add login system to secure the platform
2. **Data Validation**: Add more robust validation for uploaded files
3. **Performance Optimization**: 
   - Add database indexes for large datasets
   - Implement caching for reports
   - Use background jobs for file processing
4. **Enhanced Reporting**:
   - Add trend analysis over time
   - Implement year-over-year comparisons
   - Create PDF export option
5. **Automation**:
   - Schedule automatic report generation
   - Send email alerts for anomalies
   - Auto-import from cloud storage
6. **Data Quality**:
   - Add data quality checks
   - Highlight missing or inconsistent data
   - Provide data reconciliation reports
